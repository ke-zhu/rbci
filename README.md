# Analytical approach to the inversion of Fisher randomization tests

## Overview
This project provides R scripts and functions for constructing randomization-based confidence intervals and simulating results. The repository includes the following key components:

### Contents

- **`fun.R`**: This file contains the primary R functions used for constructing randomization-based confidence intervals. It also includes various utility functions to support these processes.
  
- **`sim.R`**: This script is used to reproduce the main simulation results and generate plots. It has been tested and executed on a personal MacBook.
  
- **`sim_supp.R`**: This script is used to reproduce supplementary simulation results. It is designed to run on a high-performance server with 80 cores to handle more extensive computations.
  
- **`output` folder**: This directory contains all the generated plots and output files from the simulations.
